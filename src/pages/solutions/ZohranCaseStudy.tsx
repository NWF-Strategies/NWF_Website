            <h2 className="text-2xl lg:text-3xl text-white font-bold mb-6">Strategy & Field</h2>
            <div className="text-lg lg:text-xl text-white mb-16 max-w-3xl">
            NWF developed targeted outreach strategies that resonated with the diverse communities in Zohran's district. Our team crafted culturally sensitive messaging that addressed key issues like housing affordability, healthcare access, and economic justice. We worked closely with local community leaders to ensure authentic engagement and build lasting relationships.<br /><br />
            Our field operation focused on deep canvassing techniques that allowed for meaningful conversations about progressive policies. We trained volunteers to discuss complex issues like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal in accessible ways, helping voters understand how these policies would directly impact their lives.<br /><br />
            Through our fellowship program, we mobilized over 200 volunteers who made direct contact with more than 50,000 voters across the district. This grassroots effort was crucial in building the broad coalition that powered Zohran's campaign to victory.
