            NWF Strategies played a pivotal role in Summer Lee's historic campaign for Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District. Our comprehensive strategy combined innovative digital organizing with deep community engagement to help elect the first Black woman to represent Pennsylvania in Congress, overcoming significant funding disadvantages through grassroots power.

            <h2 className="text-2xl lg:text-3xl text-white font-bold mb-6">Strategy & Field</h2>
            <div className="text-lg lg:text-xl text-white mb-16 max-w-3xl">
            NWF developed a multi-faceted approach that centered community voices and progressive values. Our strategy focused on building authentic relationships with voters who had been traditionally overlooked by conventional campaigns, particularly in working-class neighborhoods and communities of color across Pittsburgh and surrounding areas.<br /><br />
            We implemented innovative voter contact techniques that went beyond traditional phone banking and door-to-door canvassing. Our team organized community listening sessions, town halls, and issue-focused roundtables that allowed Summer to directly engage with constituents about their concerns regarding healthcare, jobs, and education.<br /><br />
            Through our fellowship program and local partnerships, we mobilized a diverse coalition of young activists, labor unions, and community organizations. This grassroots army made contact with over 80,000 voters, helping to overcome a significant fundraising disadvantage against well-funded opponents.
